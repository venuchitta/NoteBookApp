# Interview
Conway's Game of Life in Rails

The interview will be autonomous and last 2 hours. Please write clean well tested code. We will be judging the submission based on quality of individual commits as well as the project as a whole so be sure to commit early and often. Write a branch with your first_name-last_name as the style for the branch. For example, my submission would be on a branch titled ben-nelson. Open a pull request when you are completed or whenever the time for the interview expires, whichever comes first. 


Do not hesitate to ask questions! We will be available to clarify problems encountered.

The problem is to write a Rails application that will allow the user to play [Conway's Game of Life](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life). Since this is a zero player game we will have the user define the initial state in the Rails application and then display the outcome of the game from there to the user.

The rules of the game are as follows (taken from Wikipedia):

The universe of the Game of Life is an infinite two-dimensional orthogonal grid of square cells, each of which is in one of two possible states, alive or dead. Every cell interacts with its eight neighbours, which are the cells that are horizontally, vertically, or diagonally adjacent. At each step in time, the following transitions occur:

Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies, as if caused by under-population.
Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives on to the next generation.
Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies, as if by overcrowding.
Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours becomes a live cell, as if by reproduction.

The initial pattern constitutes the seed of the system. The first generation is created by applying the above rules simultaneously to every cell in the seedâ€”births and deaths occur simultaneously, and the discrete moment at which this happens is sometimes called a tick (in other words, each generation is a pure function of the preceding one). The rules continue to be applied repeatedly to create further generations.

Plagiarism will result in disqualification of applicants.
